**Summary**  
In this experiment, subjects completed a series of working memory tests, followed by a value-directed memory task â€“ a recall test where words are worth varying point values. We were curious as to whether high working memory subjects could more reliably prioritize: focusing study on the high value words and ignore 0 point distractions. They could, but this effect was modest, and suggests better strategies at study may be insufficient to explain the more general advantage seen in recall for those with higher working memory.
